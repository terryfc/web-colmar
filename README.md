# Project 1: Responsive Website 

Objective: 
1) To build "Colmar Academy" landing page specified by wireframe
2) To create a website that is responsive on desktop and web

Tools: 
HTML, CSS

Reflection:
This project helps to strengthen my understanding of CSS by implementation and trying out different styling. I find this 
project challenging as I just learned CSS for about a week. I was struggling with setting the alignments and positioning
of the cards (eg. "Orientation date", "Our campus") and also changing the look of the page when it's in smaller screen.

Wished I have spent more time learning CSS before this project, however I also find myself enjoying the challenges I faced
while doing this project and felt that I have learnt much faster than if I was just going through the lessons.

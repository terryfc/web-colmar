WEB Assessment 2: Colmar Academy RWD

Reflection:
1. It definitely helps and strengthen my understanding of CSS. This is definitely a challenge for me however I am happy to say that I enjoy doing it. Will need to work more on my CSS knowledge.

2. Initially the alignment, and also certain things (CSS properties) doesn't go as what I thought will do. I also struggled with media query, did a quick crash course (googling) and able to have a better idea of implementing it.

3. Will be good if we can have more time doing it, however the "short" time given is also part of the challenge for me.
